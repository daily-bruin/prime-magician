          Settled on a hilltop just blocks away from Hollywood Boulevard, the Magic Castle is a relic of the mysteries of the entertainment industry's gilded age.

          <br />
					<br />

					Vines wrap ominously around the Victorian-style mansion, with ornate designs curving up toward pointed roofs. A soft glow illuminates the manor around twilight, the sky’s purple hue reflecting off the windows.

					<br />
					<br />

					Spectators clad in their evening best huddle up under the castle’s awning, eager to get a glimpse of the reclusive world beyond the moving bookshelf.

					<br />
					<br />

					Most are not allowed to see beyond its spired exterior.

					<br />
					<br />

					Unless you’re an invited guest, the only way inside the Magic Castle is to audition to become a member of its private club, the Academy of Magical Arts. Most importantly, prospective members have to prove that they are willing to live by a “magic-first” creed – a promise to preserve the dignity and history of magic. The mansion offers cocktails and fine dining in addition to numerous magic shows in intimate locations throughout the building.

					<br />
					<br />

					With her gold member pin proudly displayed on her collar, Angela Sanchez, a UCLA graduate student in education and information studies, bypasses the line and gives the doorman a knowing nod.

					<br />
					<br />

					Though Sanchez has been coming to the castle on an almost weekly basis for years, her eyes still light up as she passes through the door.

					<br />
					<br />

					A grand bar meets guests as they enter the mansion. The walls are decorated with advertisements from 1920s movie theaters, embodying the golden age of Hollywood glamor the mansion goes to great lengths to preserve. Dress code is strictly enforced – even waiters wear coattails – and most importantly, no photography is allowed past the lobby.

					<br />
					<br />

					Banker Rollin B. Lane built the property as his private mansion near the turn of the century when the land surrounding the house was mostly filled with orange groves.

					<br />
					<br />

					The lavish chateau fell into disrepair as the decades wore on until the 1960s, when brothers Milt Larsen and William W. Larsen Jr. leased the property and converted it into the magic haven it is today. The Larsens wanted to give their father, William W. Larsen Sr., the private magic club he dreamed of creating.

					<br />
					<br />

					They couldn't imagine the success that was to come.

					<br />
					<br />

					After the Magic Castle’s doors opened in 1963, magicians made the pilgrimage from around the world to experience all that the castle had to offer.

					<br />
					<br />

					The club rapidly gained popularity among Hollywood elite, with visitors including Cary Grant, Johnny Carson and former President Ronald Reagan. More recently, actor Neil Patrick Harris served as president of the Academy for several years and Katy Perry celebrated her birthday in the castle.

					<br />
					<br />

					Sanchez arrives in a smart black dress, decorated only by her membership pin and a UCLA button. In addition to her current studies, she also graduated from the university in 2013, with a degree in history.

					<br />
					<br />

					She wants to be a college counselor to help students access higher education the way teachers helped her as a teenager. But her heart belongs to magic.

					<br />
					<br />

					***

					<br />
					<br />

					Sanchez became a member of the Academy as soon as she turned 21 – the minimum age – proving her dedication through an undergraduate thesis on the role of women in magic throughout history.

					<br />
					<br />

					Magicians are often in a position of power, and the relationship between women and power has always been complicated, Sanchez said.

					<br />
					<br />

					"You can trace that back to the witch hunts," Sanchez said.

					<br />
					<br />

					Even magic paraphernalia – top hats and trick sleeves – are closely associated with men's attire.

					<br />
					<br />

					Some women she studied broke barriers, like Adelaide Herrmann, wife of famed magician Alexander Herrmann, whose portrait hangs in a place of honor on a Magic Castle wall. When the legendary performer died suddenly on the road in 1896, Adelaide Herrmann took center stage to take over the performance.

					<br />
					<br />

					She became the known as the “Queen of Magic," and would become an inspiration for many aspiring magicians, Sanchez added.

					<br />
					<br />

					Bouncing up and down the hall, Sanchez points out her favorite magicians, her tone altering between studious and professional and that of kid in a candy shop.

					<br />
					<br />

					Her eyes linger on a poster of Goldfinger and Dove, old family friends.

					<br />
					<br />

					Like the castle's founders, Sanchez inherited her passion for magical culture from her father, a fan of card tricks and a friend of Goldfinger in his heyday.

					<br />
					<br />

					“By the time I came along my dad had stepped away from magic, but he still had his whole books of magic and Magicana. I worked my way through that by the time I was 12,” she said. “I loved reading about the misadventures of the golden era.”

					<br />
					<br />

					In middle school, Sanchez started practicing tricks in her spare time. By the time she reached high school, she started her school’s first magic club, where fellow students learned from each other and discussed magic culture. Goldfinger even came to a meeting and gave them a free performance.

					<br />
					<br />

					Once enrolled at UCLA, Sanchez was committed to fostering a magical community wherever she went.

					<br />
					<br />

					While in line on the Hill for a freshman event, a classmate named Jason Chang caught her attention.

					<br />
					<br />

					“This guy came up and said ‘Want to see something cool?’” she said, with a laugh. “I thought ‘You better be a magician.’ ... That's the only cool thing I would watch.”

					<br />
					<br />

					Turns out, he was.

					<br />
					<br />

					A small crowd started to form around them as they engaged in an impromptu magic-off. He made a scarf disappear and she whipped out her cards.

					They soon started UCLA’s first magic club, Magic and Illusion Student Team, with a handful of enthusiasts. Today, the club includes about 30 students who perform at different campus events. But back then, the club's numbers were small.

					“There were six of us and I was the chick,” she said. “(Being the only woman) is expected, it's the same thing at the castle.”
